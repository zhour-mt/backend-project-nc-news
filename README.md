# Northcoders News API

Hi! Welcome to my backend project :)

For any external developers who wish to run this file locally, please use the following instructions to help set up:

1. Create a file named '.env.test'. This file should contain the name of the database containing the test data required to implement any methods/ tests. Use the following structure: PGDATABASE=nc_news_test.

2. Create a second file named '.env.development'. This file contains the database name for all the actual, development data. Use the following structure: PGDATABASE=nc_news.

3. In your .gitignore file, add the names of the files you just made.
